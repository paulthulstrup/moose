<p>The <code>libMesh</code> library provides a framework for the
numerical simulation of partial differential equations using arbitrary
unstructured discretizations on serial and parallel platforms. A major
goal of the library is to provide support for adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) computations in parallel while allowing a research scientist to
focus on the physics they are modeling.

<br>
<br>
<code>libMesh</code> currently supports 1D, 2D, and 3D steady and transient simulations on
a variety of popular geometric and finite element types.
The library makes use of high-quality, <a href="externalsoftware.html">existing software</a> whenever possible.
<a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc">PETSc</a> or the
<a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov">Trilinos Project</a>
are used for the solution of linear systems on both serial and parallel platforms, and
<a href="http://www.mgnet.org/mgnet/Codes/laspack/html/laspack.html">LASPack</a>
is included with the library to provide linear solver support on serial machines.
An optional interface to <a href="http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc">SLEPc</a> is also
provided for solving both standard and generalized eigenvalue problems.

The <code>libMesh</code> library was first created at The
University of Texas at Austin in the
CFDLab in March 2002.  Major
contributions have come from developers at the Technische
Universit&auml;t Hamburg-Harburg
<a href="http://www.mub.tu-harburg.de">Institute of Modelling and Computation</a>,
and recent contributions have been made by CFDLab associates at
<a href="http://pecos.ices.utexas.edu/">the PECOS Center</a> at <a
href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT-Austin</a>,
<a href="https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&objID=1269&mode=2&featurestory=DA_574924">the
Computational Frameworks Group</a> at
<a href="http://www.inl.gov/">Idaho National Laboratory</a>,
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html">Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center</a>,
and <a href="http://augustine.mit.edu">MIT</a>.
The <code>libMesh</code> <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/developers.html">developers</a> welcome contributions
in the form of patches and bug reports (preferably with a minimal test case that reliably reproduces the error)
to the official <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=71130">mailing lists</a>.
Many thanks to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> for
<a href="http://github.com/libMesh">hosting the
project</a>.  You can find out what is currently happening in the
development branch by checking out the
