What is this?
-------------
We like to keep track of any publications that actually *use* libmesh
to obtain results.  It can be any type of publication: conference
talk, poster, refereed article, technical report, user manual,
dissertation, etc.  It's best if it is easily accessible from the web.
We don't track publications here that only mention libmesh in a laundry
list of FEM libraries, although it is nice to have the citations ;-)



No, I mean what are all the files in this directory?
----------------------------------------------------
A set of bibtex files (named by year, four.bib is from 2004 for
example) and a few others (preprints.bib, theses.bib) which, using the
accompanying Makefile and scripts, can be used to generate a PDF
document or the publications.php page that currently resides at
http://libmesh.sf.net/publications.php.  These scripts started life as
something I [JWP] personally maintained, but have now been
transitioned into the source repository, just in case I get hit by a
bus.



OK, so what can I do?
--------------------
* Add a new reference:
  Choose one of the templates in templates.bib, copy it to the appropriate
  year (or theses.bib or preprints.bib if appropriate) and fill in the
  relevant details.

* Generate a PDF:
  Type 'make all_pdfs'.  Assuming you have a reasonably modern version
  of LaTeX installed, it will produce a file called all_pdfs.pdf with
  all the references organized by year.  This is useful for ensuring
  that your citation renders correctly (accents, etc.) in PDF.

* Update the publications.php site:
  You must have bibtex2html installed, grab it here:

    https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html

  I built from source, but the binaries might also work for you.  Once
  that's installed and in your PATH, run the ./create_website.sh
  script.  Several files will be generated, the main one is called
  publications.php.  You may be able to view it locally by renaming it
  to publications.html and pointing your browser at
  file:///path/to/publications.html.  Once you are satisfied with the
  results, you can upload them to the libmesh site (assuming your sf
  account name is jimbob and you are a developer on the libmesh
  project) by doing:

  sftp jimbob,libmesh@web.sf.net
  cd htdocs
  put publications.php



Any other tips I should know?
-----------------------------
* I use preprints.bib primarily as a "TODO" list for citations that are
  available online, but are still lacking some piece of information, such
  as journal issue, page numbers, etc.

* If you have any problems running the script, or if you have a reference
  you want added, please let me know (jwpeterson at gmail).
