# This example does not converge with Tao when using iterative solvers
# due to preconditioning issues, but it works if you use a direct
# solver, such as SuperLU, MUMPS, or UMFPack.  An example command line
# which uses SuperLU is given below:
# ./example-opt -tao_monitor -tao_view -tao_type ipm -ksp_type preonly -pc_type lu -pc_factor_mat_solver_package superlu_dist

# If you have installed NLopt (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt) and
# libmesh has been properly configured to use it, you can uncomment the
# line below to use NLopt solvers instead of PETSc/Tao.
#
# Only a few NLopt algorithms support both equality and inequality constraints
# as required by this example, so you must run with --nlopt-algorithm followed by
# one of: LD_SLSQP, GN_ISRES, or LN_COBYLA.
