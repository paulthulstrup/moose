# Temperature Diffusion Simulation Tool

Simulation module to study temperature diffusion in nano-electronic devices in the ultra-low temperature regime.

Uses the MOOSE framework.


### MOOSE Framework

The simulation tool is using the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).

MOOSE is a finite-element, multiphysics framework primarily developed by Idaho National Laboratory. It provides a high-level interface to some of the most sophisticated nonlinear solver technology on the planet. MOOSE presents a straightforward API that aligns well with the real-world problems scientists and engineers need to tackle.
